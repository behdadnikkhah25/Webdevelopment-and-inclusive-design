            <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        </div>
        <article>
            <div>
                <h2>Universal accessibility</h2>
                <p> Our website, as our final assignment, should have the same look and layout for the first four
                    pages and ensure universal accessibility. While in the last page, the fun page, we
                    could freely let our creativity loose and explore our ideas.</p>
                <h3>Preparation</h3>
                <p>Before we started, we agreed to make the general layout and structure of the web pages as simple and
                    clean as possible, but also aesthetically pleasing. We explored all our ideas, and looked at
                    different websites for inspiration, and then decided on our layout and structure based on what was
                    the most aesthetically pleasing and clean.
                </p>
                <h3>The menu</h3>
                <p>Our first point was to make it easy to navigate between the pages, thus, we had our menu fixed on top
                    available to switch between the pages at any time. At first, we had our header fixed on the left for
                    our main
                    pages (figure 1) because we wanted to make it somewhat new and refreshing, and we could get more
                    room from top
                    to bottom for the main content, but we thought that some people with reading disabilities or visual
                    impairments
                    might have some difficulties with that as the title was rotated vertically, so we saved our idea for
                    our fun page
                    instead where we could let our creativity loose. </p>
                <h3>Screen readers</h3>
                <p>Another important group of people that we focused on was people that use screen readers. It was
                    important
                    that we used all the semantic tags available such as &lt;nav>, &lt;header>, &lt;main>, &lt;footer>,
                    &lt;figure> and &lt;em>
                    instead of &lt;i> for instance. We also made sure we used correct hierarchy of headings, and to have
                    alternative
                    texts explaining the image as detailed as possible for our important images. We also validated our
                    html and css codes regularly
                    to make sure everything was free for errors (figure 2).</p>

                            alt="Pass on the color contrast for the text and background color in this box from webAIM's constrast checker">

                    </figure>
                </div>
                <h3>Other points</h3>
                <p>Some other things we paid attention to was if the text and images had sufficient color contrast
                    (figure 3), and if we avoided the
                    color combinations that should be avoided. We also tested ourselves if it was possible to navigate
                    our website through
                    the keyboard only. On smaller screens we have a hamburger icon with a “menu”-label for our
                    navigation in case some might
                    not know that it is a menu. We also avoided javascript to make the website generally more
                    accessible.</p>
                <h3>Accessibility check</h3>
                <p>Once we made sure to use semantic tags, correct hierarchy and paid attention to text and image
                    contrast, we ran our code
                    through an accessibility check. This is a necessary and useful step that can help us detect
                    potential accessibility issues
                    that can arise. Thankfully because we were conscious of accessibility; the check showed no issues
                    (figure 4). We ran each web
                    page through the accessibility checks and got the same result.</p>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>There were things that we had to keep in the back of our mind when we started the assignment. We
                    started coding with a rough
                    idea of how we wanted our page to look. Of course, this changed further down the development
                    road as we had to think of accessibility. We also made sure to accommodate different screen sizes.
                    To conclude, we were happy with our website. </p>
