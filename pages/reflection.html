                <h2>Transition from high school</h2>
                <p>In this text, we will be discussing our last years in upper-secondary education in connection with
                    the covid-19 pandemic. We have been in state of pandemic for almost two years now which has resulted
                    in restrictions in both social interaction and education. Classes are divided into two different
                    classrooms where there must be a distance of at least one meter. In addition, there is a reduced
                    capacity of teachers, which leads to obstacles in teaching and placement in classrooms. How has the
                    pandemic affected the way teachers present the subject matter, physical education at school and the
                    social school environment?
                </p>

                </figure>
                <h3>The teaching system</h3>
                <p>The teaching has been strongly influenced by collaboration between teachers and students. This means
                    that students must have an understanding that it can be a more independent teaching environment,
                    where it is up to the student to take responsibility for their own education. The way we had this in
                    our upper-secondary school was that we split the class in two. One group that had physical education
                    at school and another group that had digital education. Such was the distribution, and it was back
                    and forth every day where the order changes for who would have physical education and digital.
                </p>
                <h3>Digital challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    The problem in this case was that there were no teachers at home with the students who had lessons
                    digitally. The teacher also did not know in the beginning if the students are involved in the
                    teaching, or if they are only logged in digitally. Therefore, they decided to introduce submissions
                    and small tests to check if the pupils were paying attention in digital lessons. As a result, this
                    led to much more homework and independent learning. There were many pupils who lost motivation since
                    there was not as effective teaching and an increase in homework.
                </p>
                <h3>The exams </h3>
                <p>
                    After a long year with a changed teaching program, the exam period was approaching. There was a
                    discussion about whether the Directorate of Education should complete the exam, even though it had
                    been a year of digital and physical school. The Directorate of Education believed that the exam is a
                    golden way to assess the student's knowledge of a subject and is conducted so that the student's
                    competence is fair and correct. This created a great deal of frustration between the students and
                    the Directorate of Education. The students objected against what the Directorate of Education
                    presented and argued that it was not fair to complete the exam. They justified their stance by the
                    fact that more time was spent getting through the syllabus than has been the case before. In
                    addition to the fact that it has varied with red and yellow levels, that is, the red zone is that
                    there is only digital teaching, and yellow meant a combination of digital in addition to physical
                    lessons.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    To conclude, the previous year has been difficult and demanding for us as students. It has been an
                    unusual year with a combination of digital and physical education. There have been many times where
                    we have lost the motivation to work with school stuff, because there has been a lot of homework and
                    confusion with physical and digital teaching. As a result, we have not been able to build on our
                    knowledge and itâ€™s been demanding to further develop our knowledge into higher education. In our
                    opinion, it has also had a (positive outcome) as freshmen in Oslomet since we learned and work
                    independently already.
